# Welcome to the official osu!Norge Github

osu!Norge is a Discord-based community by and for the norwegian osu! community. It is, at the time of writing this, the largest online hub for norwegian osu! players.

This is our official Github org. Here you'll find a couple of projects that we've used for running events as well as tools for running the Discord server. Most of them are deprecated, have shitty code or are unfinished projects. However, hopefully you'll find some of the stuff we do interesting nonetheless!

Make sure to check out our [Discord server](https://discord.gg/Y7zyjGU) as well, if you haven't already

## Don't know what "osu!" is?

TLDR: A rythm game.
